# üì∏ Web-Based Image Processing Application

---

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates fundamental image processing techniques using the **OpenCV.js** library directly within a web browser. Its purpose is to allow users to instantly see various image filters and operations applied to an image.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Diverse Image Processing Operations:** The application supports the following popular image processing techniques:
    * **Blur:** Softens the image and reduces detail.
    * **Grayscale:** Converts the image from color to shades of gray.
    * **Canny:** Detects prominent edges within the image.
    * **Threshold:** Converts the image to a binary (black and white) format based on a specific threshold value.
    * **Dilate:** Expands white pixels, effectively increasing the size of objects.
    * **Erode:** Shrinks white pixels, effectively reducing the size of objects.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A straightforward menu on the left side allows for easy selection of different image processing operations.
* **OpenCV.js Integration:** All image processing algorithms are executed directly in the browser using the high-performance **OpenCV.js** library.

## üí° How to Use

When the application loads, the example image **`vision.jpg`** will be displayed on the main screen. You can apply different image processing algorithms to the image by clicking the buttons in the left panel:

* **Main Image:** Displays the original image.
* **Blurred:** Applies a blur effect to the image.
* **GreyScale:** Converts the image to grayscale.
* **Canny:** Performs Canny edge detection on the image.
* **Threshold:** Applies a binary threshold to the image.
* **Dilate:** Dilates the white regions of the image.
* **Erode:** Erodes the white regions of the image.

## üíª Development Environment & Technologies

This project combines web development with image processing techniques, utilizing the following core technologies:

* **HTML5:** For the structural skeleton and content organization of the application.
* **CSS3:** For visual design and styling the user interface.
* **JavaScript:** For the application's dynamic behavior, DOM manipulation, and integration with OpenCV.js.
* **Google Material Icons:** For the iconic elements within the interface.

## üìù Inspiration & Customization

This project was developed by following the "Learn Computer Vision Web Development in 2 Hours" tutorial from the **Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI** YouTube channel. While the core concepts are derived from this excellent resource, I have **customized the user interface (e.g., changed logos)** and **implemented different image processing operations** to suit my learning goals and explore a wider range of OpenCV.js capabilities.
